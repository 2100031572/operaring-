WEEK 1
Key Concepts
Describe Unix
Install and/or access Bash
Execute basic commands in the command line
Create and manipluate directories
Inspect, move, copy, and delete files and folders
Module 1: Unix and Command Line Basics
This week we'll help you get access to Unix (you may already be using it), and you'll start using the command line. We'll draw parallels between using your mouse and keyboard with your computer's graphics versus only using the command line.

Graded: Command Line Basics

WEEK 2
Key Concepts
Solve problems by consulting documentation
Use wildcards on the command line to work with multiple files and folders
Use grep, egrep, metacharacters, regular expressions, and find to search in file and directories
Customize Bash
Examine differences among files
Use pipes to deploy the output of one command as the input of another command
Module 2: Working with Unix
Now we'll get into the power of different Unix tools. We'll walk through several scenarios where you could use Unix to perform tasks at a much faster speed than you would be able to normally.

WEEK 3
Key Concepts
Create a program using Bash
Use Bash to perform basic arithmetic
Store data in variables using Bash
Use Bash to collect user input
Create arrays in Bash
Use brace expansion to create strings out of sequences
Use loops to repeat lines of codes based on logical conditions or sequence
Module 3: Bash Programming
During this week we'll unleash the command line's usefulness as a programming language. By the end of this week you'll be writing your own little computer programs that you can use on the command line.

Graded: Bash Programming

WEEK 4
Key Concepts : Git and GitHub

Use Git to track versions of code
Use GitHub to create a remote Git repository
Create Git branches
Fork GitHub repositories and open a pull requests
Key Concepts : Nephology

Connect to the Cloud using Digital Ocean
Use Bash to find and move files in the Cloud
Create a GitHub bot
Communicate with other servers in the Cloud
Automate tasks in the Cloud
Module 4
Git and GitHub
First you'll learn how to use Git, which is like "track changes" for your code and plain text files, but much more powerful. We'll then explore how to use Git with GitHub, a social coding network where you can publish you projects and explore other's code.

Graded: Git & GitHub
Graded: Bash, Make, Git, and GitHub

Nephology
Finally we'll set up a cloud computing environment so we can explore how computers communicate with each other using the internet.
